# üêß Linux Cheatsheet

- `N\B:` When using these commands and you notice they don't run use `sudo` infront of the command.
- This is because:
    - Some distros such as `Ubuntu` have disabled root login.
    - It's simpler and safer for multi-user systems which prevents sharing of the root password.

## üìÇ Files, Folders and Directory Management

- Creating a new file:

```sh
    touch filename
    touch filename_1 filename_2 filename_3 # Create new files simultaneously
    cp old_filename new_filename
    vi filename # Be careful with this if you do not know how to use the vim editor.
```

- Creating a new directory:

```sh
    mkdir directoryname
    mkdir directoryname_1 directoryname_2 directoryname_3 # Create new directories simultaneously
```

- Create the directory with the full path (just incase one does not exist):

```sh
    mkdir -p directorypath
```

- View the current file path:

```sh
    pwd # Print Working Directory
```

- Viewing files and folders in a directory:

```sh
  ls
```

- Viewing files and folders in a directory with detailed information (`l - long format`):

```sh
  ls -l
```

- Linux Filesystem:
    
```sh
    /boot - Contains the file used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
    /root - Root user home directory (Different from /)
    /dev - System devices e.g. disk etc
    /etc - Configuration files
    /bin -> /usr/bin - Everyday user commands
    /sbin -> /usr/sbin - System/ filesystem commands
    /opt - Optional add-on apps (Not part of OS apps)
    /proc - Running processes
    /lib -> /usr/lib - C programming librayr files needed by commands and apps
    /tmp - Contains temporary files
    /home - User directory
    /var - System logs
    /run - System daemons that start very early (systemd, udev) storing temporary runtime files like PID files.
    /mnt - Mount external filesystem (e.g. NFS)
    /media - cdrom mounts
```

- List files in long format with human-readable sizes (`h - human readbale sizes`):

```sh
  ls -lh
```

- List files and directories in the current directory in descending form based on modification time (`r - reverse order (starts with older files), t - sort by time`):
  
```sh
  ls -ltr
```

- List files with the permissions and the sizes together with the hour:

```sh
  ls -ltrh
```

- Deleting directories with files in it:

```sh
  rm -rf directoryname
```

- View contents of a file:

```sh
  cat file_name
```

- Display the last 10 lines:

```sh
  tail filename.txt
```

- Display the specific number of lines (i.e. 1000 last lines):

```sh
  tail -n 1000 filename.txt
```

- Display the specific number of bytes (i.e. 500 last bytes):

```sh
  tail -c 500 filename.txt
```

- Handling multiple files:

```sh
  tail filename.txt filename2.log
```

- Display new lines added to the file in real time (i.e. 200 last new lines):

```sh
    tail -200f filename.txt
```

- Copy a file from one location to another:

```sh
    cp source destination
```

- Copy a file to another directory:

```sh
    cp filename directoryname
```

- Copy a directory and its contents:

```sh
    cp -r old_directoryname new_directoryname
```

- Move a file from one location to another:

```sh
    mv source destination
```

- Rename a file:

```sh
    mv old_filename new_filename
```

- Move a directory:

```sh
    mv directoryname new_directory_filepath
```

- Find a file that you forgot where it is:

```sh
    find . -name "filename" # . shows the current directory
    find / -name "filename" # Starts from the root directory hence needs root privilege to run it
    locate filename # Ensure you have installed mlocate package
```

- Changing permissions of a file:

```sh
   # Using letters
   chmod o-w filename # Removes the write permission from others
   chmod g+r filename # Adds the read permission to group
   chmod u+rwx filename # Adds the read, write & execute permissions to user 

   # Levels: 
   # u g o 
   # | | |
   # | | ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Others
   # | ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Group
   # ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ User

   # Permissions: 
   # r w x 
   # | | |
   # | | ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Execute
   # | ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Write
   # ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Read
```

```sh
    # Using numeric mode
    chmod 005 filename # Removes the write permission from others
    chmod 040 filename # Adds the read permission to group
    chmod 700 filename # Adds the read, write & execute permissions to user 

    # Key:
    # 0 - No permission
    # 1 - Execute
    # 2 - Write
    # 3 - Execute + Write
    # 4 - Read
    # 5 - Read + Execute
    # 6 - Read + Write
    # 7 - Read + Write + Execute

    # N\B: Overwites permissions hence good practice to remember the existing permissions of the other levels before changing
```

- Changing ownership of a file:

```sh
    chown owner filename
    chgrp groupname filename

    # Owners:
    # * User * Group

    # Format:
    # owner group
```
